## Executive Summary

After deep analysis of the codebase and research into Irish solar market (2024-2025), I've identified **15 key areas** for accuracy improvements across technical calculations, financial estimates, and data quality.

---

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working Well âœ…
1. âœ… Flux-based filtering (>60% threshold)
2. âœ… Separate usable vs total roof area
3. âœ… Backend-calculated capacity
4. âœ… PVGIS fallback for rural areas
5. âœ… Modern panel efficiency (20%)

### Critical Issues Found ðŸ”´

#### 1. **Energy Calculation Error** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: `resultMath.py` line 82
```python
annual_energy_kwh = mean_flux * usable_roof_area * panel_efficiency * performance_ratio
```

**Problem**: This is DOUBLE-COUNTING efficiency losses!
- `mean_flux` is already in kWh/kWp/year (Google Solar API provides this)
- Then multiplying by `panel_efficiency * performance_ratio` applies losses AGAIN
- Result: Underestimates production by ~15%

**Correct Formula**:
```python
# Method 1: Using capacity
annual_energy_kwh = estimated_capacity_kwp * mean_flux * performance_ratio

# OR Method 2: From raw irradiance (if available)
# annual_energy_kwh = solar_irradiance_kwh_m2 * usable_roof_area * panel_efficiency * performance_ratio
```

#### 2. **Performance Ratio Too Low**
**Current**: 75% (0.75)
**Industry Standard** (Ireland 2024): 80-85% for modern systems

**Breakdown of Losses**:
- Inverter efficiency: 96-98% (modern inverters)
- Temperature losses: 10-12% (Ireland's cool climate helps!)
- Soiling/shading: 2-3%
- Wiring/mismatch: 2-3%
- **Total realistic PR**: 82-85%

**Recommendation**: Use 0.82 for residential, 0.84 for commercial

#### 3. **Area per kWp Inconsistency**
**Current**: 6.5 mÂ²/kWp
**2024 Reality**: 
- Modern panels (400W+): 5.0-5.5 mÂ²/kWp
- Standard panels (350-380W): 5.5-6.0 mÂ²/kWp
- Older panels (300W): 6.5-7.5 mÂ²/kWp

**Recommendation**: Use 5.5 mÂ²/kWp for 2024 installations

#### 4. **Cost Estimates Need Refinement**
**Frontend** uses sliding scale, **Backend community service** uses fixed â‚¬1,500/kWp

**2024 Irish Market Research**:
| System Size | Cost Range (â‚¬/kWp) | Typical Total |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 2-4 kWp     | â‚¬1,500-â‚¬1,800    | â‚¬4,500-â‚¬6,000 |
| 4-6 kWp     | â‚¬1,300-â‚¬1,500    | â‚¬6,500-â‚¬8,000 |
| 6-10 kWp    | â‚¬1,200-â‚¬1,400    | â‚¬8,400-â‚¬12,000|
| 10-20 kWp   | â‚¬1,000-â‚¬1,200    | â‚¬12,000-â‚¬20,000|
| 20+ kWp     | â‚¬900-â‚¬1,100      | Variable      |

**SEAI Grant Impact**: -â‚¬2,400 for residential (not currently factored in!)

#### 5. **Electricity Rate Accuracy**
**Frontend**: â‚¬0.38/kWh âœ… (Good!)
**Reality Check** (Q4 2024):
- Day rate: â‚¬0.35-â‚¬0.42/kWh
- Night rate: â‚¬0.18-â‚¬0.25/kWh
- Average weighted: â‚¬0.38/kWh âœ…
- **BUT**: Self-consumption rate matters more!

**Missing Factor**: Not all solar energy offsets grid electricity
- Typical home: 30-40% self-consumption without battery
- With battery: 60-80% self-consumption
- Export rate (Clean Export Guarantee): â‚¬0.185/kWh (2024)

**Better Calculation**:
```python
self_consumption_rate = 0.35  # 35% without battery
export_rate = 0.185  # â‚¬/kWh
import_rate = 0.38   # â‚¬/kWh

savings = (annual_energy * self_consumption_rate * import_rate) + \
          (annual_energy * (1 - self_consumption_rate) * export_rate)
```

#### 6. **Flux Threshold Too Conservative**
**Current**: 60% of mean flux
**Problem**: May exclude east/west-facing areas that are still viable

**Research**: 
- South-facing: 100% production
- East/West-facing: 75-85% production  
- North-facing: 40-60% production (Ireland's high latitude helps!)

**Recommendation**: 
- Use 50% threshold (not 60%)
- Add orientation-based weighting if DSM data available

#### 7. **Missing Roof Pitch Consideration**
**Current**: No pitch analysis
**Impact**: Huge! Affects both area and production

**Irish Residential Roofs**:
- Typical pitch: 35-45Â°
- Optimal for Ireland: 35Â° facing south
- Flat roofs need tilt frames (reduces usable area by 40%)

**Should Calculate**:
```python
if roof_pitch < 10:  # Flat roof
    area_reduction_factor = 0.6  # Tilt frames needed
    tilt_angle = 35  # Optimal tilt
else:
    area_reduction_factor = 1.0
    tilt_angle = roof_pitch
```

#### 8. **Obstruction Factor Too High**
**Current**: 15% for obstructions
**Reality**: Varies dramatically by building type
- Modern houses (post-2000): 5-8%
- Older houses: 12-18%
- Commercial buildings: 3-5%

**Better Approach**: Analyze from DSM/imagery if available

#### 9. **Missing Shading Analysis**
**Current**: Only using flux threshold
**Missing**: Nearby buildings, trees, terrain

**Google Solar API Provides**:
- `hourlyShadeUrls` - hour-by-hour shading data
- Can calculate precise shading impact!

**Impact**: 10-30% production difference

#### 10. **PVGIS Usability Factor Too Aggressive**
**Current**: 55% of total roof is usable
**Problem**: Too pessimistic for well-oriented roofs

**Better Approach**:
```python
# Base usability by building type
if building_type == 'residential':
    base_usability = 0.65
elif building_type == 'commercial':
    base_usability = 0.75
    
# Adjust for estimated shading (from PVGIS data)
# Adjust for roof complexity (estimate from area)
```

## Recommended Improvements (Prioritized)

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Implement Immediately)

#### A. Fix Energy Calculation
```python
# resultMath.py - Replace lines 82-83
# WRONG (current):
annual_energy_kwh = mean_flux * usable_roof_area * panel_efficiency * performance_ratio

# CORRECT:
annual_energy_kwh = estimated_capacity_kwp * mean_flux * performance_ratio
```

#### B. Update Performance Ratio
```python
performance_ratio = 0.82  # Was 0.75 - now more realistic
```

#### C. Update Area per kWp (Modern Panels)
```python
area_per_kwp = 5.5  # Was 6.5 - reflects 2024 panel tech
```

#### D. Add SEAI Grant to Frontend
```python
const seaiGrant = 2400  // â‚¬2,400 for residential solar PV
const netCost = installationCost - seaiGrant
const effectivePayback = netCost / annualSavings
```

### Priority 2: Improved Financial Accuracy

#### E. Implement Self-Consumption Model
```python
# In frontend calculations
const selfConsumptionRate = 0.35  # Conservative estimate
const exportRate = 0.185  // â‚¬/kWh
const importRate = 0.38   // â‚¬/kWh

const selfConsumedEnergy = annualEnergy * selfConsumptionRate
const exportedEnergy = annualEnergy * (1 - selfConsumptionRate)

const annualSavings = (selfConsumedEnergy * importRate) + 
                      (exportedEnergy * exportRate)
```

#### F. Dynamic Cost Calculation (Backend)
```python
def calculate_installation_cost(capacity_kwp: float) -> float:
    """Calculate realistic cost with economies of scale"""
    if capacity_kwp < 4:
        return capacity_kwp * 1650
    elif capacity_kwp < 6:
        return capacity_kwp * 1400
    elif capacity_kwp < 10:
        return capacity_kwp * 1300
    elif capacity_kwp < 20:
        return capacity_kwp * 1150
    else:
        return capacity_kwp * 1000
```

### Priority 3: Enhanced Technical Accuracy

#### G. Reduce Flux Threshold
```python
flux_threshold = flux_stats.get('mean', 0) * 0.50  # Was 0.60
```

#### H. Adjust Obstruction Factor by Building Age/Type
```python
# Estimate from roof area (larger = likely commercial)
if roof_area_sq_meters > 500:
    obstruction_factor = 0.95  # 5% reduction
elif roof_area_sq_meters > 200:
    obstruction_factor = 0.90  # 10% reduction
else:
    obstruction_factor = 0.88  # 12% reduction (typical residential)
```

#### I. Add Monthly Production Breakdown
```python
# Use PVGIS monthly data to show seasonal variation
# Helps users understand winter vs summer production
```

### Priority 4: Advanced Features

#### J. Utilize Hourly Shade Data
```python
# If Google Solar API provides hourlyShadeUrls
# Calculate precise shading impact
# Adjust production estimates accordingly
```

#### K. Roof Orientation Weighting
```python
# Use DSM data to estimate roof orientation
# Apply production factors:
# South: 1.00
# SE/SW: 0.95
# East/West: 0.80
# NE/NW: 0.65
# North: 0.50
```

#### L. Add Battery Storage Estimates
```python
# Optional battery recommendations
battery_capacity_kwh = capacity_kwp * 2  # 2 hours storage
battery_cost = battery_capacity_kwh * 700  # â‚¬700/kWh typical
improved_self_consumption = 0.70  # With battery

additional_savings = annual_energy * (improved_self_consumption - 0.35) * import_rate
battery_payback = battery_cost / additional_savings
```

### Priority 5: Data Quality & Validation

#### M. Add Confidence Scores
```python
def calculate_confidence_score(analysis_result):
    confidence = 100
    
    # Reduce confidence if:
    if not has_high_res_imagery:
        confidence -= 20
    if roof_area > 1000:  # Likely commercial/complex
        confidence -= 15
    if flux_std > flux_mean * 0.3:  # High variance = shading
        confidence -= 10
    if usable_area < total_area * 0.3:  # Low usability
        confidence -= 10
        
    return max(confidence, 40)  # Minimum 40%
```

#### N. Sanity Check Validations
```python
def validate_results(results):
    """Flag unrealistic results"""
    warnings = []
    
    # Check production per kWp
    production_per_kwp = results['annual_energy'] / results['capacity']
    if production_per_kwp < 700 or production_per_kwp > 1400:
        warnings.append(f"Unusual production rate: {production_per_kwp} kWh/kWp/year (expected 900-1200 for Ireland)")
    
    # Check cost per kWp
    cost_per_kwp = results['cost'] / results['capacity']
    if cost_per_kwp < 800 or cost_per_kwp > 2000:
        warnings.append(f"Cost seems unusual: â‚¬{cost_per_kwp}/kWp (expected â‚¬1000-â‚¬1600)")
    
    # Check payback period
    if results['payback'] < 2 or results['payback'] > 15:
        warnings.append(f"Payback period seems unusual: {results['payback']} years (expected 3-10)")
    
    return warnings
```

#### O. Add Location-Specific Adjustments
```python
# Ireland has regional solar variations
# West coast: Lower irradiance (800-950 kWh/mÂ²/year)
# East coast: Higher irradiance (950-1100 kWh/mÂ²/year)

def get_regional_adjustment(latitude, longitude):
    # Simple adjustment based on longitude
    # More negative = further west = less sun
    if longitude < -8.5:
        return 0.95  # West coast penalty
    elif longitude < -7.5:
        return 0.98
    else:
        return 1.00  # East coast baseline
```
